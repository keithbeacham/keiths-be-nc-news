To connect to the database, the PGDATABASE environment variable needs to be set to the database in use. There are two databases available, test and development. The links are set using two files in the root directory: .env.test and .env.development.

setup:
.env.test - sets up system for test database, contains "PGDATABASE=<test database name>"
.env.development - sets up system for development database contains "PGDATABASE=<development database name>"

contact author for <test database name> and <development database name>
